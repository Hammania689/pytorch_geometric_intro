# Introductory Tutorials and Overview of the PyTorch Geometric library :)
## Pytorch Geometric `Version 1.3.0` as of July 2019

You can reference PyTorch Geometric [github][pyGeo_git] and [documentation][doc].

This repo provides [tutorials from PyTorch Geometric's introduction pages][doc] in a jupyter notebook form. 

* More Examples are in the `\examples` subdirectory. 
* The notebook from [Fast Graph Representation Learning with PyTorch Geometric][paper] gives overview of PointNet++
* Excellent talk from [Soumith Chintala][soumith_talk] from the Geometry and Learning from Datat in 3D and Beyond at IPAM 2019.
